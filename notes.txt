#1: All of these sites have "wcm" in probably 80% of their articles, but for some article, that keyword is not present
    So not all of the sites above have been marked by the #1 because for those, I could't find an article where the keyword
    didn't appear, but the threat can still be present. 
    Fortunately, it seems that all of those sites are using the same framework, so finding a solution for one could equal
    finding a solution for them all.

website hard to parse: 
- daily herald tribune
- red deer advocate
- winnipeg free press
- brandon sun
- times colonist
- trail times 
- tj.news            => Agressive Paywall
- the telegram
- the chronicle herald
- salt wire
- niagara falls review
- le droit
- st catharines standard
- welland tribune
- www.theguardian.pe.ca
- journal pioneer
- la voix de lest
- white horse star
- www.sherbrookerecord.com
- www.ledevoir.com  => its wierd, their articles are usually preceded with a 6 digit number in the URL
                       https://www.ledevoir.com/monde/""""174172""""/afghanistan-un-dirigeant-d-al-qaida-est-tue
                       but the location of that number can be difficult to predict since file structure is not constant
- journalmetro.com  => same thing as ledevoir, so if I can split the url path with "/" as a delimiter and loop through
                       the list of strings to see if one of them is only numeric, this could work.
